## Build and Use
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Type `make` to compile and build the project.
3. Execute the generated executable.
 
## Attention
If you want to test step 1 or 2, there may be some problem about memory IO but I solved them all in the step3. So use the code there instead.

## Testrun
Due to time limit, it's unfinished yet.
